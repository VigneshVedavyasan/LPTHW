These are code I have typed by hand to learn python.
The source of these code where from this site:

http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html

This is an excellent site to learn the basics of python by typing in each exersice given or try something different so you can understand paradigms of python better. It is an easy OOP language.
